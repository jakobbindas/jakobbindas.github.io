							<p>
								The mysteries of outer space have always caught my attention. From my first Sci-FI exposure through <i>Star Wars</i> at the age of four to actually studying
								these mysteries through my research, these mysteries have had such a drastic influence on how I decided to shape my academic career. It struck me during my
								junior year of high school that I would be able to study the unknowns of space in an academic setting. However, I applied to the University of Pittsburgh as 
								a mechanical engineering major in hopes of contributing to the exploration of outer space. I soon realized that I was not drawn to the mechanical design and 
								implementation aspects of engineering like I felt I should have been to make a meaningful academic career on this path. I made the decision to go back to my 
								original interests in learning more about what is out there in outer space and changed course into the physics and astronomy program at Pitt.
							</p>

							<p>
								As I made headway throughout my degree, I decided I wanted to give research a try, as this would allow me to explore the unknown of space at a higher level.
								I began working on a project in the fall semester of 2021, working under Prof. Carles Badenes and Ph.D. Candidate Christine Daher analyzing close period 
								binary core helium burning (red clump) stars and investigating why a binary companion still exists around a red clump host star when the secondary star should
								have been engulfed by the red clump star during its evolution through the red giant branch. Shortly after starting on this project, I found myself recruited
								to <a href="/stepup">STEPUP</a> as the new data processing lead in order to repair the (still) broken data processing pipeline, SIA (STEPUP Image Analysis).
								I am currently not working on either of these projects as I am participating in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, 
								funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). I am working with Prof. Jamie Tayar investigating various models for an effect known as weakened magnetic braking
								in late main sequence and early sub giant stars. 
							</p>

							<p>
								My projects continue on, but I am left with even more doubts about a career regarding research. I recently made the decision to stay at the University of Pittsburgh
								for a fifth year and pursue a second degree in computer science. Programming is something that is still relatively new to me as I only started coding in a class
								I took during the spring 2020 semester, but it is something that I have enjoyed ever since picking it up. Since starting, I have developed various skills in both Java
								and Python and wish to further develop myself as a programmer. I have been starting to practice more on LeetCode to aid my development. I also wish to start 
								learning HTML and CSS as I am finding an interest in website design.

								When I am not working on school work or either of my current research projects, I mostly enjoy spendign my time playing volleyball. I am currently the libero
								(number 4) for the Pitt Men's Volleyball Club (PMVBC)'s A-Team. I have been a part of a few intramural teams and also play casually whenever possible on the lawn
								of the Cathedral of Learning at Pitt. If I am not playing volleyball, you may find me skiing at Seven Springs during ski season or simply at my computer 
								speedrunning my favorite video games. I am also trying my best to get into astrophotography, so a lot of my more recent time has been spent researching various
								cameras, star trackers and telescopes. I currently have six dogs, five of which are huskies (pictured above) and one black lab (not pictured).

							<p>
								I am currently interested in stellar evolution, with a focus in stellar rotation, and exoplanetary research. I want to become more
								involved with writing computational astrophysics code. I hope to be able to explore other fields as well,
								such as research involving black holes and gravitational waves.

								<b>Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at University of Florida</b><br>
								Advisor: Prof. Jamie Tayar </br>
								In 2016, Jennifer van Saders provided evidence that current stellar rotation models are predicting a higher rotation period than what has been observed due to a 
								phenomenon known as weakened magnetic braking. This discovery has implications for a wide variety of astronomical subfields as using stellar rotation periods is one of the most popular methods of probing stellar
								ages, and thus interpolating various stellar parameters. The accuracy of gyrochronology method is crucial to confirm that these ages are precise as possible.
								I am currently analyzing different models that account for this weakened magnetic braking and will soon come to a decision on the accuracy of existing models.
								Using a combination of <a href=https://github.com/zclaytor/kiauhoku target="blank">Kiauhoku interpolation grids</a> and APOGEE DR17 (and possibly Kepler DR25) data, I will perform proper data fitting between observed and theoretical
								rotation periods to ensure the accuracy of these models.

								<b>Red Clump Stars' Unlikely Binary Companions</b><br>
								Advisor: Prof. Carles Badenes </br>
								Using the APOGEE Data Release 16, I am investigating properties about core helium (red clump) binary systems. In particular, I am analyzing red clump stars 
								with a particularly high change in radial velocity, which is an indicator that these stars still contain a short period binary companion. 
								This is not something expected as the secondary star should have been engulfed by the red clump star during its evolution through the red giant branch, especially
								at the shorter periods that we are observing.

								STEPUP is the Survey of Transiting Extrasolar Planets at the University of Pittsburgh that uses the Allegheny Observatory’s Keeler 16” telescope
								to detect extrasolar planets (exoplanets). We take observations (weather permitting) and collect data about stars that we then analyze to determine
								if there is actually a planet in the host star's orbit. To do this, we currently perform Instrument Signature Removal (ISR) with our data processing
								pipeline, SIA (STEPUP Image Analysis), and perform photometry using an external program known as AstroImageJ. We take the output file from AIJ to
								produce light curves for our analysis. <a href="https://sites.pitt.edu/~stepup/index.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about STEPUP!
							</p>
							<p>
								I serve as the current Data Processing Lead for STEPUP. Currently, I am working on a curve fitting function that takes the raw data from an AIJ output
								file and use Python to fit for the transit depth and transit time, ultimately giving us the ingress and egress times of the transit. I am fitting to 
								the light curve function provided by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210099">Mandel & Agol (2002)</a>. I have been able to produce a light curve
								from initial guesses for various parameters, the actual curve fitting for parameters, such as the ingress and egress of the transit and the transit depth,
								are still a work in progress. <br><br>
								Over the summer, I plan to repair SIA, as we are currently experiencing issues with the Astrometry feature as we are using a CCD that is incompatible with 
								the World Coordinate System (WCS) Tools that we run our data through. I also plan to redesign the STEPUP website.
