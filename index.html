							<p>
								As I made headway throughout my astrophysics degree, I decided I wanted to give research a try, as this would allow me to explore the unknown of space at a higher level.
								I began working on a project in the fall semester of 2021, working under Prof. Carles Badenes and Dr. Christine Daher analyzing close period 
								binary core helium burning (red clump) stars and investigating why a binary companion still exists around a red clump host star when the secondary star should
								have been engulfed by the red clump star during its evolution through the red giant branch. Shortly after starting on this project, I found myself recruited
								to <a href="/stepup">STEPUP</a> as the new data processing lead in order to repair the (still) broken data processing pipeline, SIA (STEPUP Image Analysis).
								I am currently not working on either of these projects as I am participating in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, 
								funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). In the summer of 2022, I worked with Prof. Jamie Tayar investigating various models for an effect known as 
								weakened magnetic brakin in late main sequence and early sub giant stars. This summer I am working with Prof. Jen van Saders and Dr. Marc Hon in probing red giant masses
								using asteroseismology.
							</p>

							<p>
								I spend a lot of time coding. My strongest languages include Python and Java while I am familiar with C, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Most of my coding experience comes framework
								in class assignments and projects and from working on my research.
							</p>

							<p>
								I recently visited the observatories at Mauna Kea, HI, and fell in love with the scene. I am big on observing and hope to gain telescope time!
							</p>

							<p>
								I am most passionate about my dogs. We have eight dogs in our pack, seven of which are huskies. Almost a year ago, I adopted my boy Maverick and haven't looked
								back since. One day, I hope to be able to rescue huskies from shelters and rehome them with families that will properly care for these beautiful dogs. I hope to
								have enough land to start my own sanctuary so I am able to bring these dogs back into good health.

							<p>
								When I am not working on school work or working on my research, I mostly spend my time playing volleyball. I am currently the libero
								(number 4) for the Pitt Men's Volleyball Club (PMVBC)'s A-Team. I have been a part of a few intramural teams and also play casually whenever possible on the lawn
								of the Cathedral of Learning at Pitt. If I am not playing volleyball, you may find me skiing at Seven Springs during ski season or simply at my computer 
								speedrunning my favorite video games. I am also trying my best to get into astrophotography, so a lot of my more recent time has been spent researching various
								cameras, star trackers and telescopes.

							<h3 class="major">Research Interests</h3>

							<p>
								My research interests are rooted in stellar astrophysics. I have experience working with asteroseismic data (KEPSEISMIC & APOKASC) probing red giants for information
								such as details about their rotation periods used for gyrochronology and frequency of maximum power directly in asteroseismology. In previous work, I have also 
								looked at the close binary fraction of red clump stars. See below for more details about the projects I am involved with.
							</p>

							<h3 class="major">Upcoming Projects</h3>
							<p>
								<b>Studying the Effects of Shadow Bands (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023)</b> <br>
								Faculty: Prof. Russell Clark, Prof. Istvan Danko, Prof. Sandhya Rao, Prof. David Turnshek <br>

								Previous data has been collected to confirm the existence of a shadow band effect during solar eclipses. With the two upcoming solar eclipses in 
								October 2023 (annular) and April 2024 (total) crossing paths near San Antonio, TX, we plan to use NASA funded equipment to study this effect in
								greater detail. We consider two approaches: launch High Altitude Balloons (HABs) to study light variations due to shadow bands 
								and launch weather balloons with radiosondes to study any relationship to turbulence. The team consists of four faculty members, two staff members,
								three consulting faculty and ten undergraduate students at the University of Pittsburgh. I will be working primarily on the team launching the weather
								balloons with radiosondes.

								<b>Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at University of Hawai'i Institute for Astronomy (IfA) (Summer 2023)</b><br>
								Advisor: Prof. Jen van Saders and Dr. Marc Hon <br>
								I am currently working with 30 minute long cadence Kepler data looking to develop a more reliable method of measuring the quantity <b>&nu;<sub>max</sub></b> which is used to describe
								stellar parameters as it is related to the mass, effective surface temperature and radius of the star. We are looking to move away from the need to transform our 
								time series data into the frequency domain as this method requires fitting for a complicated background model to describe the "noise" of the frequency oscillations.
								Using the instantaneous frequencies of the pulsations, our method will be purely empirical.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at University of Florida (Summer 2022)</b><br>
								Advisor: Prof. Jamie Tayar </br>
								In 2016, Jennifer van Saders provided evidence that current stellar rotation models are predicting a higher rotation period than what has been observed due to a 
								phenomenon known as weakened magnetic braking. This discovery has implications for a wide variety of astronomical subfields as using stellar rotation periods 
								is one of the most popular methods of probing stellar ages, and thus interpolating various stellar parameters. The accuracy of gyrochronology method is crucial 
								to confirm that these ages are precise as possible. Using a combination of <a href=https://github.com/zclaytor/kiauhoku target="blank">Kiauhoku interpolation grids</a> 
								and APOGEE DR17 data, I have shown that there is still a discrepancy between empirical and theoretical rotation periods.

								<b>Red Clump Stars' Unlikely Binary Companions (Fall 2021 - Spring 2022) </b><br>
								Advisor: Prof. Carles Badenes </br>
								Using the APOGEE Data Release 16, I have investigated properties about core helium (red clump) binary systems. In particular, I analyzed red clump stars 
								with a particularly high change in radial velocity, which is an indicator that these stars still contain a short period binary companion. 
								This is not something expected as the secondary star should have been engulfed by the red clump star during its evolution through the red giant branch, especially
								at the shorter periods that we are observing.

							<p>
								STEPUP is the Survey of Transiting Extrasolar Planets at the University of Pittsburgh that uses the Allegheny Observatory’s Keeler 24” telescope
								to detect extrasolar planets (exoplanets). We take observations (weather permitting) and collect data about stars that we then analyze to determine
								if there is actually a planet in the host star's orbit. To do this, we currently perform Instrument Signature Removal (ISR) with our data processing
								pipeline, SIA (STEPUP Image Analysis), and perform photometry using an external program known as AstroImageJ. We take the output file from AIJ to
								produce light curves for our analysis. <a href="https://sites.pitt.edu/~stepup/index.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about STEPUP!
							</p>
							<p>
								I serve as the current Data Processing Lead for STEPUP. Our current objective is to create a more efficient data processing pipeline that can properly process
								data from the Allegheny Observatory’s new 24" Keeler PlaneWave telescope. Our old pipeline has been experiencing issues moving to a higher field of view CCD
								during the astrometry process. I plan to create a pipeline using the SIA framework with an improved performance. To do this, I am working with Dr. David Turnshek
								monitoring quasars for long term variability. The pipeline <i>should</i> work for both the quasar and exoplanet differential photometry, but it is too early to confirm.
