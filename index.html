							<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
							<p>
								I have always been intrigued by the idea of space. Since I was about four years old, space has been a part of my life in various ways. From being 
								introduced to Star Wars from my now stepfather at the age of four to having stars and other space related objects onmy ceiling that would light up 
								at night to starting to learn more about various processes, space related topics have always caught my eye. Most importantly, it is a topic that has 
								always held my curiosity, no matter what. I came into my freshman year at the University of Pittsburgh as a Mechanical Engineering major, hoping to get a job
								working on rockets in hopes of advancing space travel. However, I realized that engineering was not for me after my first semester and started to do
								some self-evaluation and ended up switching into the Physics and Astronomy program.
							</p>

							<p>
								As I began progressing through my degree, I realized that this would be one of the best decisions I could make for myself. I found something to
								study that I was truly passionate about and something that I could see myself enjoying enough to make a meaningful career out of. I began my research
								career in the fall semester of 2021, working under Prof. Carles Badenes and Ph.D. Candidate Christine Daher studying red clump stars. Shortly after
								this semester began, I was asked to join <a href="/stepup">STEPUP</a> as the new data processing lead due to my coding background. This summer, I 
								will be working under Prof. Jamie Tayar at the University of Florida, participating in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, 
								funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). As of now, I do not have much information about the topic I will be researching. I am anticipating
								graduating from the University of Pittsburgh in spring 2023 and moving on to graduate school to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics and Astronomy. Currently,
								I am hoping to pursue research in computational astrophysics.

								When I am not working on school work or either of my current research projects, I like to spend my time playing volleyball. I am currently the libero
								(number 4) for the Pitt Men's Volleyball Club (PMVBC)'s A-Team. I am often at my computer in my apartment speedrunning video games and talking with my out of state friends in Discord. 
								As I was making this website, I realized I was having a <i>lot</i> of fun with it, and I am going to spend a lot of time learning more about HTML and
								CSS. I enjoy developing my coding skills in Java, but mostly Python. I also enjoy spending time back at home lounging around with my pack of five huskies and black lab,
								pictured above (I adopted the red husky, Kaya).

								<b>Red Clump Stars' Unlikely Binary Companions</b><br>
								Advisor: Prof. Carles Badenes </br>
								I am currently using the APOGEE Data Release 16 to investigate core properties about core helium (red clump) binary systems. 
								In particular, I am analyzing red clump stars with a particularly high change in radial velocity, which is an indicator that 
								these red clump stars still contain a short period binary companion. This is not something we would expect to observe since 
								these stars should have engulfed their companion during its evolution through the red giant branch (RGB).

								STEPUP is the Survey of Transiting Extrasolar Planets at the University of Pittsburgh that uses the Allegheny Observatory’s Keeler 16” telescope
								to detect extrasolar planets (exoplanets). We take observations (weather permitting) and collect data about stars that we then analyze to determine
								if there is actually a planet in the host star's orbit. To do this, we currently perform Instrument Signature Removal (ISR) with our data processing
								pipeline, SIA (STEPUP Image Analysis), and perform photometry using an external program known as AstroImageJ. We take the output file from AIJ to
								produce light curves for our analysis. <a href="https://sites.pitt.edu/~stepup/index.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about STEPUP!
							</p>
							<p>
								I serve as the current Data Processing Lead for STEPUP. Currently, I am working on a curve fitting function that takes the raw data from an AIJ output
								file and use Python to fit for the transit depth and transit time, ultimately giving us the ingress and egress times of the transit. I am fitting to 
								the light curve function provided by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210099">Mandel & Agol (2002)</a>. I have been able to produce a light curve
								from initial guesses for various parameters, the actual curve fitting for parameters, such as the ingress and egress of the transit and the transit depth,
								are still a work in progress. <br><br>
								Over the summer, I plan to repair SIA, as we are currently experiencing issues with the Astrometry feature as we are using a CCD that is incompatible with 
								the World Coordinate System (WCS) Tools that we run our data through. I also plan to redesign the STEPUP website.
